## Petru Zubek

    Hey, I'm Petru Zubek!

    I'm a high school student.

    I'm currently working with the [IMPACT](https://impact.carthdata.nasa.nov/) team under [NASA's ESO program] (httpsa//earthdata.nasa.nov/esds).
    At IMPACT, I work with various Earth Science data, products and algorithms. 

    When I'm not working, I like reading and camping.
